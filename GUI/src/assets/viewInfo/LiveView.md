# Live View

The Live view is designed for live performance. Its purpose is to provide a reduced set of module controls for 
each Block, with custom control sizes and layout for convenience. When in Live view the computer keyboard also 
becomes active for navigating between Scenes.

* Controls can be added to the Live view by selecting arrange view, clicking ‘+’ on the relevant block, and then 
clicking the checkbox in the top right corner of the required controls.

* An entire Module’s controls can be added or removed from the Live view using the checkbox on each Module.

* Controls can also be added directly in Live view by right-clicking the canvas and selecting a control from the menu.

* Controls in Live view can also be moved and re-sized by dragging their background and edges respectively.
