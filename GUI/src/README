Building from the command line requires the file app-config.xml to be in the build directory.

This file can be generated by adding the -dump-config <path> options to the compiler in Flash Builder

For convenience, an 'input' app-config.xml.in has been provided in this directory. An app-config.xml can be created by typing:

    $ make app-config.xml
