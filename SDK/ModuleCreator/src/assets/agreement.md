## Summary

- The Integra Module Developer SDK is released under an MIT-style license 
- The license has an additional clause requiring that all modules created with the software are dedicated to the public domain
- This ensures that all Integra Modules can be legally distributed with Integra Live projects without restriction
- The Integra Module Creator tool will therefore embed a [public domain "unlicense"](http://unlicense.org/) with all Module and Module Bundle files
