# Curvature Mode

Click here to switch the Block's Envelopes into curvature mode.

In curvature mode, Control Points cannot be added, removed or repositioned.

Instead, dragging the line segments between Control Points edits the the exponent base for the control point interpolation.  
This allows you to apply curvature to Envelope transitions.

Double click a line segment to revert to a linear interpolation.
