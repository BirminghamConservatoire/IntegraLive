=============================================
Integra Project Browser
(v0.1 by Dan Squier - 21/08/2014)
=============================================
An experimental collection of assets for the processing, display, and validation of Integra project files based on XML-oriented technologies.

To view the output, use a web browser to open the main file 'default.xml' via a hosted virtual path.

Note that browser security restrictions will typically prevent integrated XSL handling for files accessed directly from the file system.
