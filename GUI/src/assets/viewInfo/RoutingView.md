# Routing View 

In Integra Live, Tracks, Blocks and Modules all have parameters that are used to store values representing their current settings. 

These values can be routed so that when a source parameter changes, the value of any target parameters also changes. 

This can be used for example, to route the value of a slider on an external controller to ‘room size’ of a reverb, 
or to route the value of a ‘play’ button to another ‘play’ button so that playback of two separate modules starts simultaneously.

* To add routing within a Block, select a Block, then click the routing tab in the block properties panel, then click the ‘+’ icon to add a new route.
* The drop-down menus can then be used to set the source module, source parameter, target module and target parameter.
* The same process can also be used for routing between blocks or tracks, by selecting the parent track or project respectively.
