# Markdown Parser [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/apiaryio/markdown-parser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/apiaryio/markdown-parser)

`Markdown Parser` purpose is to process a Markdown file and produce its abstract syntax tree (AST for short) which is suitable for further machine-processing. The AST also includes source maps for its nodes.

Markdown Parser is currently built on top of the (now deprecated) [`sundown`](https://github.com/apiaryio/sundown) library. In the future the `sundown` may be replaced with [`hoedown`](https://github.com/hoedown/hoedown/) libray or even [`Redcarpet`](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) "C" core.
