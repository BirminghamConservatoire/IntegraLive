# Info
This pane displays in-app help about how to use each part of Integra Live.

Try moving the mouse over different parts of the application, and you will see help for each thing as the mouse moves over it.

You can give the focus to this help pane at any time, by pressing F2.  This allows you to scroll and interact with hyperlinks.

## Editing

Some help content is user-editable.  This feature allows you to add inbuilt documentation to Integra Live projects.  You can add your own information to:

* Projects
* Tracks
* Blocks
* Scenes

When adding your own information, you can use 'markdown' notation, to achieve things like headings, bold, italics, bullet points and hyperlinks.
