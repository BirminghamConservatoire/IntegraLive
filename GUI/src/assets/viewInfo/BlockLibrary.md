# Block Library

Drag any of these Blocks onto a Track in Arrange view to load them.

The Block Library is an expandable set of demo Blocks which have been created by the Integra Live developers to get you started.

You can also add your own blocks to the Block Library, in order to reuse them across multiple projects.  
Do this by right-clicking the Block, and choosing 'Export' -> 'Add Block to Block Library'.
