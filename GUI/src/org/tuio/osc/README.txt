This directory contains a snapshot of org/tuio/osc from the tuio-as3 project:

    http://code.google.com/p/tuio-as3/

At the time of taking the snapshot, the project was licensed under the GNU GPL v3 on Google Code.

The tuio-as3 library is extensive, providing functionality for tuio gesture tracking and so on. We have only used the OSC classes, in fact only

    OSCMessage
    OSCPacket
    OSCTimeTag

These are convenient, because they allow easy unpacking of OSC ByteArray data
