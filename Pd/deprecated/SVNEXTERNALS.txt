# svn:external references to the most uptodate (unstable) sources of integralive
#
# this uses the new svn:externals syntax introduced with Subversion 1.5
# see also http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.advanced.externals.html
#
# adding external-references:
#       - add a new line below with the format: <directory-name> <external link>
#       - the directory must not exist yet
#       - if possible use an external link that would allow commits (for
#       authorized)
#         e.g. "https://" instead of "http://"
#
#       - finally run:
#               % svn propset svn:externals -F SVNEXTERNALS.txt .
#               % svn commit
#
# deleting external-references:
#       - just delete the offending reference and re-run:
#               % svn propset svn:externals -F SVNEXTERNALS.txt .
#               % svn commit
#
# you should be able to retrieve this file by running
#               svn propget svn:externals .
