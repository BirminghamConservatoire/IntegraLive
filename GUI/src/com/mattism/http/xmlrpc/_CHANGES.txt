Version 0.9.3 Beta (Dec 22 2005)
    * Fixed broken ARRAY creation for method params

Version 0.9.2 Beta (Nov 23 2005)
    * Fixed some silly issues involves addParam
    * Added an example for posting to a WordPress blog

Version 0.9.1 Beta (Nov 15 2005)
    * Created unit tests for the Parser
    * Now creating real native objects rather than strings

Version 0.9.0 Beta (June 2005)
    * Refactored just about everything.

Version 0.8.5 Beta (Jan 10 2005)
    * Fixed endless loop bug. If OnLoad or OnFailed were undefined then
      they would trigger __resolve which would then call the '_call' method
      which would result in OnLoad or OnFailed being called again which then 
      trigger __resolve, etc.

Version 0.8.4 Alpha (Dec 02 2004)
    * Things just got a whole lot better. Instead of having
      to use Connection.Call('myMethod'), you can now use:
      Connection.myMethod();
      That is sweet.
    
    * AddParameter signature Changed **IMPORTANT**
    
    * Added XMLRPC.Types constants
    
    * Documentation!
    
Version 0.8.3 Alpha (Dec 01 2004)
    * Broke out parsing to a new Class
    
    * Normalized variable names
    
    * Removed RTrace, replaced with simple DTrace
    

Version 0.8.2 Alpha (Nov 19 2004)
    * Refactored the sending and loading of XML
    
    * Connection and Method now subclass XML rather
      keeping a private XML Object attribute.
      
    * The task of triggering the XML sending
      and loading has been taken from Method and given
      to Connection. I think that makes more sense.
      
    * Method is now just used for the creation of
      valid XMLRPC XML.
      
    * Fixed possible memory leak


Version 0.8.0 Alpha (April 21 2004)
