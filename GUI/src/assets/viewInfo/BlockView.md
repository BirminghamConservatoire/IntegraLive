A Block is a small collection of connected Modules. Blocks are used to organise Modules into logical groupings that make musical sense.

* To add a Block from the Block library, click the Block name and drag it onto a Track
* To add a new empty Block, double-click an empty area inside a Track
* To activate a Block, drag the playhead so that it is vertically aligned with the Block
* Blocks can be re-sized by click-dragging their left or right edge
