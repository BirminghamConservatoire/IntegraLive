==========
LibIntegra
==========

LibIntegra provides a number of components that can be used in isolation or in combination. These components can be used by an application wishing to support the Integra protocol for multimedia module design and intermodule communication.

A complete list of features can be found by viewing the header files, or reading the doxygen documentation, available with this package, or at http://integralive.sourceforge.net

There is also a substantial amount of documentation on the wiki at http://wiki.integralive.org


Dependencies
------------

libIntegra requires:

- automake >= 1.6
- xmlrpc-c >= 1.06.27
- libxml2 >= 2.6.20

For Lua scripting:

- liblua >= 5.1.0

For the OSC interface and OSC bridge

- liblo >= 0.26

Installation
------------

To build and install the library with the common options enabled type:

    sh libIntegra-install.sh

Otherwise the general build and install commands are of the form:

    ./configure --osc_interface
    make
    sudo make install

To find out more configuration options:

    ./configure --help

The standard install directory is /usr/local/lib. The PD [integra] external (see below for more information) relies on libIntegra and you may need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH for PD to be able to find the libIntegra shared lib. In a bash shell:

    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib

If you would rather install the library in /usr/lib add a --prefix flag to the configure script:

    ./configure --enable-osc_interface --prefix=/usr


Building the PD example
-----------------------

In examples/PD there is an example PD external that illustrates the use of libIntegra and the integra_pd_bridge.

To build this:

    cd examples/PD
        make pd_darwin 
            -or-
        make pd_linux
            -or-
        make mingw
    sudo make install

You should also make sure that /usr/local/lib/pd/extra is in PD's path

If you want to try the example patches, you must make sure that both the patches/ and patches/ntg directories are in PD's path.
